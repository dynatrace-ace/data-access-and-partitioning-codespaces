If you’ve completed the _Get Started_ steps, you should now have a Dynatrace tenant set up and the necessary environment variables to configure for your Codespace.

```bash
DT_TENANT=https://abc12345.sprint.dynatracelabs.com
# Dt tenant stuff
DT_OPERATOR_TOKEN=<dt-access-token>
DT_INGEST_TOKEN=<dt-access-token>
MONACO_TOKEN=<dt-access-token>
## Acc Mgmt stuff
CLIENT_ID=<client-id-acc-mgmt>
CLIENT_SECRET=<dt-secret-acc-mgmt>
SSO_ENDPOINT=https://sso-sprint.dynatracelabs.com/sso/oauth2/token
```

## 🚀 Deploy (8 minutes)

1. Click here to start configuring your codespace 
  
    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/dynatrace-ace/data-access-and-partitioning-codespaces?quickstart=1&machine=basicLinux32gb){target="\_blank"}

    
## ☕️ Wait and Learn

We know your time is valuable. This codespace takes around 8 minutes to be fully operational. A local Kubernetes [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster monitored by Dynatrace will be configured and in it a sample application. 
    
## ✅ Validate 

After 8 minutes, your Codespace should be ready

Check if the monitoring is functional, and that the Management Zone has been created in your environment.

> Note: A Management Zone is provided intially to simulate an _existing customer_ scenario, during the lab we will learn new mechanism for Access Control & Segmentation
