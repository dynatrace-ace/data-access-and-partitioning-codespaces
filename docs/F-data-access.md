## Data Access

#### The Easytrade scenario

Easytrade, a fast-growing fintech platform, has just expanded its operations across multiple regions and teams. With 13 microservices powering everything from login to trading, the platform is now managed by several specialized teams: infrastructure, observability, and application owners.

As the company scales, so does the complexity of managing access to observability data. The infrastructure team needs full control over configurations, while application teams only need read access to their own services. Meanwhile, everyone should be able to view SLOs and dashboards.

To avoid chaos and manual permission management, Easytrade decides to implement a scalable IAM strategy in Dynatrace, one that uses custom roles, policy boundaries, and group-based access control.

Your main goal in this lab is to help Easytrade build this strategy from the ground up.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand how Dynatrace IAM works.
- Learn how to create and manage roles, policies, boundaries, and groups.
- Apply scoped access using `dt.security_context` and a management zone.
- Minimize maintenance effort by decoupling permissions from scopes.

### Approach 1 - Using Default Dynatrace Policies

<!--#### Exercice 1: Create permissions for default users

We want to grant all users with "default" access to Dynatrace. Granting them the ability to use the Platform:
- Basic usage
- Basic apps and features

>ðŸ’¡This is just about allowing usage, and not granting access to data.

**Task 1: Explore the default Dynatrace Policies**

1. Navigate to the Account Management Portal > Identity & access management > Policy management
2. Explore the different policies of category "Dynatrace access"
3. Understand which policy is a good fit for all Dynatrace Users

**Task 2: Assign the policy to the Default group with all users**

1. Navigate to the Account Management Portal > Identity & access management > Groups
2. Edit "Default group with all users"
3. Click on the "+ Permission" button
4. Fill the form:
- Permission name: "Standard User"
- Scope: tick the "Account (all environments)" box
- Boundaries: leave empty
5. Click on "save"

***-->

#### Exercice 1: Create a boundary for "Easytrade"

Now that any Dynatrace User can access the default features, we want to allow users to access specific observability data.

> ðŸ’¡We want to create a boundary for the 'Easytrade' app that will be attachable to any permission.

**Task 1: Create the boundary**

1. Navigate to the Account Management Portal > Identity & access management > Policy management, and to the "Boundaries" tab
2. Click on the "+ Create boundary" button
3. Fill the form:

- Boundary name: "Easytrade"
- Boundary query:

<details>
  <summary>Boundary query:</summary>

```sql
storage:dt.security_context IN ("easytrade", "EasyTrade");
// "EasyTrade" format comes from MZ format (grail security context for monitored entities)
environment:management-zone IN ("EasyTrade");
```

</details>

- Click on "Save"

![](img/content/lab3-ex2-task1-create-boundary.png)

#### Exercice 2: Create Access for Easytrade "Readers"

We now want to grant specific users with "Readers" access to Dynatrace. Allowing them to see data in the different apps.

> ðŸ’¡We want to create a group for the 'Easytrade' app with read permissions.

**Task 1: Explore the default Dynatrace Policies**

1. Navigate to the Account Management Portal > Identity & access management > Policy management
2. Explore the different policies of category "Data access" and "Dynatrace access"
3. Understand which policy is a good fit for Dynatrace "Readers"

**Task 2: Create a group for the Easytrade Readers**

1. Navigate to the Account Management Portal > Identity & access management > Group management
2. Click on the "+ Create group" button
3. Fill the form

- Name: "[Readers] Easytrade"
- Description: "Grants reading permissions to observability data for the Easytrade team"

4. Click on "Create"

![](img/content/lab3-ex3-task2-create-group.png)

**Task 3: Assign the policy and boundary to the [Readers] Easytrade group**

1. On the newly created group edition page
2. Click on the "+ Permission" button
3. Fill the form to grant access to Dynatrace:

- Permission name: "Standard user"
- Scope: tick the "Account (all environments)" box
- Boundaries: "Easytrade"

4. Click on "Save"
5. Add another permission to grant access data, click on "+ Permission" and fill the form:

- Permission name: "All Grail data read access"
- Scope: tick the "Account (all environments)" box
- Boundaries: "Easytrade"

4. Click on "Save"

#### Exercice 3: Create Access for Easytrade "Writers"

We now want to grant specific users with "Writers" access to Dynatrace. Allowing them to edit monitoring configurations in the different apps.

> ðŸ’¡We want to create a group for the 'Easytrade' app with writers permissions.

**Task 1: Create a custom policy for the Writers**

1. Navigate to the Account Management Portal > Identity & access management > Policy management
2. Click on "+ Create policy"
3. Fill the form

- Name: "[Lab] Writers"
- Policy description: "Statements granting write permissions"
- Policy statement:

<details>
  <summary>Write permissions on settings â€“ Settings</summary>

```sql
ALLOW settings:schemas:read;
ALLOW settings:objects:read, settings:objects:write;
ALLOW environment:roles:manage-settings;
```

</details>
