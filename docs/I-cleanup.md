!!! tip "Deleting the codespace from inside the container"
    We like to make your life easier, for convenience there is a function loaded in the shell of the Codespace for deleting the codespace, just type `deleteCodespace`. This will trigger the deletion of the codespace.


Another way to do this is by going to [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces){target=_blank} and delete the codespace.

You may also want to deactivate or delete the API token needed for this lab.
