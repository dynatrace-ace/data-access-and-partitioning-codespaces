## Introduction

Imagine you're stepping into a real world engagement with a customer using Dynatrace Classic. The customer is interested in starting to setup the foundations of the 3rd-Gen Platform. 

### Where should I start?





The customer has a Kubernetes cluster running two applications:

- Easytrade – a trading platform with multiple microservices
- Hipstershop – a demo e-commerce app used for observability testing

These apps are deployed across different namespaces and environments, and your mission is to help the customer modernize their observability strategy using Dynatrace Gen 3 capabilities.

### What to Expect?

Throughout the labs, you’ll take on the role of a Dynatrace expert working directly with the customer. Each lab represents a critical phase of the migration journey, and by completing them, you’ll gain hands-on experience with:

- Extracting and enriching metadata
- Designing and implementing scalable IAM strategy
- Creating precise data filters using Segments
- Partitioning logs for performance and cost efficiency
- Allocating observability costs across teams and services
